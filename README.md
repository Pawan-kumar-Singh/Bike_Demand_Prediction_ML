# Bike_Demand_Prediction_ML

Bike sharing demand prediction refers to the process of forecasting the number of bikes that will be rented in a specific location at a given time. Accurately predicting demand is critical for the success of a bike-sharing system, as it allows operators to ensure that there are enough bikes available for rent at each station.

There are several approaches that can be used for bike sharing demand prediction, including:

Time series analysis: This method uses historical data to identify patterns in demand over time and forecast future demand based on these patterns. Factors such as the day of the week, seasonality, holidays, and weather conditions are taken into account.

Regression analysis: This method uses statistical techniques to model the relationship between independent variables (such as weather and day of the week) and the dependent variable (number of bikes rented).

Machine learning algorithms: This approach involves using algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and artificial neural networks to learn from historical data and predict future demand.
